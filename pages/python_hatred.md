### Hatred with python

- The language allows you to utilize curly braces for e.g. if-statements just as C
  ```python
    a = 10
  
    if a == 10: {
    
      print("A is 10")
    }
  ```
  `Output: A is 10`

  And it's not like this is a recent thing, this was introduced way back in [1998](https://www.python.org/doc/humor/#python-block-delimited-notation-parsing-explained)
